## Antenna Test Report.pdf
This is a fillable Adobe Acrobat PDF form. 

**Note:** The fillable PDF form must be saved to your computer and opened with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC in order for all of the fields (including the ability to attach the product and VSWR graph images) to function. Adobe Acrobat Reader DC can be [downloaded here](https://get.adobe.com/reader/). Opening the fillable PDF form in your browser using the acrobat plugin does NOT work. 

After filling in the form simply "print" the completed file as a new PDF (Ctrl-P on PC, CMD-P on Mac and select "Adobe PDF" as your printer.) This will result in a finished PDF file which is no longer fillable.
